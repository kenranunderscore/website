* First blog post

Example text with some =verbatim stuff=, and some ~code here~.

This is
- a list
- of things
- with bullet points.

Some /italic text/ and some *bold text* as well.

Now for code. Haskell:

#+begin_src haskell
data Foo = Bar | Baz Int
  deriving stock (Eq, Show)
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp
(defun (foo bar)
  (setq foo "abc")
  (setq bar 'blub))
#+end_src

#+begin_src nix
let f = drv: drv + ./foo + "abc";
in { a = import https://hi.git; b = "${./bla}" }
#+end_src

Clojure:

#+begin_src clojure
(defrecord Rec [field])

(defun foo [x]
  (fn [a]
    (->Rec (+ a x))))
#+end_src
